# Getting Started

Thank you for using Anzu! If you have no desire to deploy your own but want to test the functionalities of the chatbot, [feel free to add Anzu as one of your friends in LINE.](https://line.me/R/ti/p/@087wqrja) However, please remember that Anzu is still in the development version, so you cannot schedule, delete, or do anything with the bot for now. You can only add her as a friend and probably do a few things.

As an alternative, you could deploy her by yourselves. You can use Anzu by inviting her to a room or a group, or by simply chatting her and using the available commands, explained in the next section.

For starters, you could follow the following guidelines.

Anzu is available for the following commands:

1. (/schedule <deadline> <job_name>) to schedule your tasks, make sure that the date format is in 'YYYY-MM-DD'!
2. (/tasks) to show all available tasks
3. (/delete <job_name>) to delete available tasks in this environment
4. (/reschedule <new_deadline> <job_name>) to reschedule a task in this environment to a new deadline
5. (/finish <job_name>) to finish a job. This is the same as deleting a task, but with a different message
6. (/help) to spawn the help menu
7. (/leave) to make me leave (if on a group or multi-chat environment)
8. Just mention my name in the chat (Anzu) and I will return to you!

Several examples:

2. /delete New Year's Eve!
3. /tasks
4. /schedule 2021-02-14 Valentine's Day!

As a note, you can use me by inviting me to a group, a room, or by just simply messaging me! The commands are compatible with each other!

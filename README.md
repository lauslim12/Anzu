## Architecture

- Asynchronous Programming
- Functional Programming
- JavaScript Programming Language
- Shell Scripts and Micro Computers for Automation
- Vue.js for Documentation

Anzu is divided into two subprojects: `bot` for the bot itself, and `docs` for the documentation. The `bot` is made with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) from scratch, while the `docs` is bootstrapped using [Vue.js / Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Documentation

Anzu's full documentation could be seen at [this website](https://lauslim12.github.io/Anzu/). The documentation covers the installation guide, usage examples, list of commands, and many more! Check it out!
